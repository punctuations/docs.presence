## Why can't I see more stats on discord/user?

The discord/user endpoint utilizes [lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard) which allows more information to be returned about a user, i.e. custom status, games, and spotify. To show more data about discord you can join the [lanyard discord server](https://discord.gg/WScAm7vNGF). It also uses [discord.bio](https://discord.bio) to show a description if present.
